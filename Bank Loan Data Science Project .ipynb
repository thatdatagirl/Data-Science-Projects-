    "Based on the data, there are many factors that contribute to people paying back a loan on time. For example, it looks as if people in a relationship with a significant other are less likely to default on a loan and owe debt. The main reason I believe that people in relationships are able to pay back a loan on time is because they are in a two income household with more disposable income. This also explains why people with a high-level income also have less debt. Another deciding factor is the amount of children that a person has because according to the data the less children the less debt. This could be due to the fact that there is extra income available that is not spent on child care to pay loans back on time. In order to determine who will be a viable candidate the different factors should be compared together to get a better overall picture. My analysis of the data concludes that the most viable candidate to repay a loan on time would be a married person with no kids and a high-level income. "
